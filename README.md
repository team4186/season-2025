# [FRC-2025] REEFSCAPE

### Forked from swerve template made by [Yagsl](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example)

Beneath the ocean’s surface lies our planet’s most complex ecosystems, full of life and potential for exploration and
learning, where each inhabitant has a role to play in building a thriving environment. During the 2024-2025 FIRST
season, [FIRST® DIVE℠ presented by Qualcomm](https://info.firstinspires.org/first-dive), teams will use their STEM and
collaboration skills to explore life beneath the surface of the ocean. Along the way, we’ll uncover the potential in
each of us to strengthen our community and innovate for a better world with healthy oceans.
